The following application examples demonstrate how to use Coral FPGA Resource
Manager, to automatically scale your accelerated solutions using in-house or
3rd-party accelerators, from high-level programming languages.

InAccel provides a stack of accelerators including Machine Learning techniques,
Financial formulas, SQL functions and Cryptographic algorithms. Please check
[InAccel Store](https://store.inaccel.com) for a complete list of the available
cores.

The projects in this section enable the seamless integration of
[InAccel Coral](https://inaccel.com/coral-fpga-resource-manager) with the
available FPGA accelerators through high-level programming interfaces. This
integration makes it possible to accelerate applications using state-of-the-art
frameworks for big data analytics (like Apache Spark) requiring **zero changes**
in your original application code.

What these projects basically do, is pairing together these two worlds providing
complete accelerated solutions. From your perspective nothing has changed,
except that from now on your applications will run lightning fast.

## Supported FPGA Vendors

!!! hint "InAccel supports both Intel and Xilinx FPGAs"
	Currently there are two major FPGA vendors, Xilinx and Intel (formerly
	Altera). InAccel solutions are built for **both** FPGA families and **all**
	the platforms they provide.

## Supported Cloud Platforms

!!! hint "Find us on **every** public Cloud with FPGA instances"
	All major cloud vendors have started deploying FPGAs in their
	infrastructure. InAccel is **among the first** companies providing
	production-ready solutions on Amazon, Alibaba, Nimbix and Huawei Cloud
	services.
