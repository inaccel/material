## Definition of: bitstream

A bitstream is a binary sequence that contains the programming information for
an [FPGA](fpga.md). The bitstream is typically provided by the hardware designer
who builds the [accelerator](accelerator.md).

A bitstream can be packaged and installed as an artifact, which can be used
afterwards by a [Coral](coral.md) application. A bitstream artifact can be also
deployed to a remote repository, like [InAccel Store](inaccel-store.md).
