## Definition of: repository

A repository is a set of bitstreams. A repository can be shared by pushing it
to a file server. The different bitstreams in the repository can be grouped and
versioned efficiently using a simple specification file (in JSON/XML format).

Here is [InAccel Store](https://store.inaccel.com), the first public bitstream
repository.
