## Definition of: accelerator

The phrase "FPGA accelerator" usually refers to a specialized FPGA design that
performs a specific math function. Accelerators are compiled and linked against
a target FPGA platform, resulting to a binary file known as
[bitstream](bitstream.md).

InAccel provides a stack of ready to use accelerators for Machine Learning
techniques, Financial formulas, SQL functions and Cryptographic algorithms.
