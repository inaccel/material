## Definition of: container

A container is a runtime instance of a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com)
image, that wraps up code and all its dependencies so the application runs
seamlessly through different environments. A container image is a lightweight
collection of software along with execution parameters for use within a
[container runtime](container-runtime.md).
