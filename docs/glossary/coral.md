## Definition of: Coral

InAccel Coral is a distributed acceleration framework designed to orchestrate
clusters of FPGAs. It abstracts away the [FPGA](fpga.md) resources (device,
memory), enabling fault-tolerant heterogeneous distributed systems to easily be
built and run effectively.

The main concepts behind Coral are:

* **Ease of Use**

	Write applications quickly in C++, Java, Scala and Python.

* **Generality**

	Build your own repository of accelerators.

* **Scalability**

	Industry proven to easily scale to unlimited FPGA resources.

* **Runs Anywhere**

* **Easy to Deploy**

* **Resource Management**

	Automatic resource configuration and task scheduling across entire FPGA
	clusters in private datacenters or public cloud environments.

* **Privacy / Isolation**

	Coral allows the secure sharing of the hardware resources among different
	users and multiple processes or threads.

* **Web UI**

	Built-in Web UI for viewing cluster state, navigating in memory objects and
	monitoring acceleration tasks.
