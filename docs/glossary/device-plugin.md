## Definition of: device plugin

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) provides a device plugin framework that you
can use to advertise system hardware resources to the Kubelet. Instead of
customizing the code for Kubernetes itself, vendors can implement a device
plugin that you deploy either manually or as a DaemonSet.

The InAccel FPGA plugin for Kubernetes allows you to automatically:

* Expose the type and number of FPGAs on each node of your cluster

* Keep track of the health of your FPGAs

* Run FPGA enabled containers in your Kubernetes cluster
