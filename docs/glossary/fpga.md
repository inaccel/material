## Definition of: FPGA

Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is semiconductor device that is based
around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable
interconnects. It can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality
requirements after manufacturing. This feature distinguishes FPGAs from
Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are custom manufactured
for specific design tasks. Due to its programmable nature, FPGA can be an ideal
fit for many different markets and applications like Networking, Machine
Learning, Data Centers, High Performance Computing and more.
