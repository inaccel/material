InAccel is a world-leader in application acceleration using **FPGAs** in the
cloud.

We embrace cutting-edge technology to help companies speedup mission-critical
applications in the cloud and reduce their the total cost of operations (OpEx).

### Accelerators

We provide both **readily available** accelerator cores and
**customized solutions** based on the customerâ€™s requirements. The accelerators
are provided in the form of ***IP cores*** and can be used either
**on premises** or **in the Cloud**. FPGA accelerators can massively accelerate
computational intensive algorithms and that is why they are a perfect fit for a
plethora of cutting edge fields including data analytics, machine learning,
compression algorithms etc.

!!! hint "Wide Compatibility"
	InAccel accelerators are fully compatible with **Amazon AWS**,
	**Alibaba Cloud** and **Huawei Cloud** FPGA instances. They are also
	compatible for both **Intel** and **Xilinx** FPGAs.

### FPGA Resource Manager

Inaccel's FPGA Resource Manager provides **transparent** acceleration to the
user. The whole idea lies in the concept of **client - server** architecture.
The FPGA Resource Manager serves as the server entity waiting for any user
requests (clients). A user can simply implement and run **accelerated tasks**
using the Manager's **API**.

!!! hint "Containerized environment and Flawless Scalability"
	InAccel offers its FPGA Manager in a Docker container that can be downloaded
	right from the Docker Store. This way we guarantee easy deployment and an
	isolated environment that will not interfere with your system's settings.
	And if you have more than one FPGAs running on your system, then that is not
	a problem for us. FPGA manager scales out managing multiple FPGAs at the
	same time.

### Seamless Integration

We do care for the seamless integration of our accelerators with widely used
frameworks like Apache Spark, Tensorflow etc. Acceleration of tasks as a
technique isn't a new factor but it always came at the price of understanding
how accelerators work and messing up with very low level information.
**We believe that acceleration is acceptable only when it comes at no further costs**.
That is why we also provide a framework that seamlessly offers acceleration for
Apache Spark ML library. Just install an FPGA card on your system or choose an
FPGA instance on the Cloud and let our framework take acceleration to a whole
new level.

!!! hint "Zero code changes"
	Using the term **seamless integration** we mean **zero code changes** in
	your applications. Just install our framework and run your Spark ML
	applications as you would in the past.
